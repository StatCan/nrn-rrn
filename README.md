# National Road Network (NRN)

The NRN was adopted by members from the Inter-Agency Committee on Geomatics (IACG) and the Canadian Council on Geomatics
(CCOG) to provide quality geospatial and attributive data (current, accurate, consistent), homogeneous and normalized of
the entire Canadian road network. The NRN is part of the GeoBase initiative which aims to provide a common
geospatial infrastructure that is maintained on a regular basis by closest to source organizations.

The NRN is distributed in the form of thirteen provincial / territorial datasets consisting of two linear entities
(road segments and ferry segments), three punctual entities (junctions, blocked passages, and toll points), and three
tabular entities (address ranges, street and place names, and alternative name linkages). Currently, the NRN is publicly
available on the open government data portal (https://open.canada.ca/en).

The NRN content largely conforms to ISO 14825 (https://www.iso.org/standard/54610.html).

# Redevelopment

This project aims to redevelop the NRN processing module as a fully automated pipeline purely in open-source Python and
SQL. This redevelopment was agreed upon due to the poor documentation, outdated technology, and only semi-automation of
the pre-existing NRN module inherited by Statistics Canada.

# Usage

The pipeline is implemented as a directly callable python module, executed as a command line interface.

## Installation

TBD.

## Execution

TBD.
