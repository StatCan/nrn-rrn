Overview
========

The NRN implements several validations against the attributes and geometry of constituent datasets. Most of the
currently implemented validations were adopted from the NRCan NRN process while a few are StatCan additions. Some
validations may be removed or modified after consultation with GeoBase partners as required. It is important to note
that not all validation failures are truly errors, but rather flags against potential errors which is up to the data
provider to review. Reference to such validations and the associated data records as errors is only for consistency and
simplicity of references.

Error Code Structure
====================

All validations have been assigned a unique error code with the following composition:

    :Structure: E (Fixed Letter) || Major Error Code || Minor Error Code
    :Format: E ### ##
    :Example: E00103
