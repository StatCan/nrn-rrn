Terms and Definitions
=====================

Attribute
    Characteristic of a feature. For example, number of lanes or pavement status.

Class
    Description of a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, methods, relationships, and semantics.
    A class does not always have an associated geometry (e.g., address range class).

Feature
    Digital representation of a real world phenomenon.

Ferry Connection
    The average route a ferryboat takes when transporting vehicles between two fixed locations on the Road Network.
    Two Junctions always bound a Ferry Connection.

Network Linear Element
    Abstract class of a Road Element and Ferry Connection.

Object
    An object is an instance of a class.

Road Element
    A road is a linear section of the earth designed for or the result of vehicular movement. A Road Element is the
    representation of a road between Junctions. A Road Element is always bounded by two Junctions. A Road Element is
    composed of one or more than one contiguous Road Segments.

Segment
    Portion of a Network Linear Element that has a common set of defined characteristics (attributes).

Universal Unique Identifier (UUID)
    The definition and method used for the generation of a Universal Unique Identifier is defined in the document
