Overview
========

This document describes recommendations and format used for data exchange between NRN data providers. It is important
to note that this physical data model does not constitute the final distribution model for the NRN data.

The document results from eight consultation meetings performed with Closest to Source data providers. The broad range
of the producer and user committee participants has allowed this process to identify and review many aspects of the
physical data exchange model.

We wish to thank the producer and user community both at the federal and provincial levels who have contributed to this
exercise an in doing so have ensured that the best possible exchange format for the NRN datasets will be implemented.
