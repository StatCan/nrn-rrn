Network Linear Element
    Several layers of vector data, referred to as National Vector Data (NVD), will share
    the same specification. The National Road Network (NRN) and National Hydrographic
    Network (NHN) are examples of NVD.

Overview
========

The objective is to update the NVD product on a regular basis as soon as mechanisms have
been established between NRN partners. One of the update mechanisms is by establishing
change management principles. The establishment of change management principles is founded
on two basic concepts: identification rules and definition / classification of change.

The concept of Identification is based on objects that depict real-world phenomena that
vary over time, either by their description, by their precision or by the instruments and
methods involved in their initial acquisition. It is therefore possible that more than one
representation of the same phenomena may exist. To illustrate this fact, as part of this
initiative, the goal is to build and maintain a **single** representation of the National
Road Network. Identifiers play a fundamental role in ensuring long-term distributed data
management and for implementing update mechanisms of Objects modified at the source and
already provided to users. The implementation of a standard for the permanent identification
of a phenomenon and its application must achieve two primary objectives:

* Facilitate the management and distribution of object changes in an incremental manner;
* Facilitate the conflation process, if necessary.

Every occurrence of NVD basic features must be uniquely identified: As an example, each
geometric object in the NRN: *Road Element*, *Ferry Connection*, and *Junction* that describe
specific characteristics of the linear network must also be uniquely identified.

Identification Standard
=======================

The Identifiers must be permanently assigned or persistent. To ensure their stability, the
assigned IDs must be insignificant (inconsequential) in their expression [#f1]_. In other
words, the IDs must not contain any information relative to the data. Past experience has
demonstrated that encapsulating information within the ID can cause ID modification
without any real change ever having occurred in the data.

Several standards have dealt with the Road Network. Most of them point to the importance of
using Identifiers without ever specifying the manner, format, or method of application.
GDF [#f2]_, GIS-T (GIS in transportation data standards) [#f3]_ and CEN TC 278 [#f4]_
documentation have no specifications related to Identifiers. National Spatial Data
Infrastructure – USA (NSDI) Framework Transportation Identification Standard was the only
document that clearly defined and described an Identifier code [#f5]_. However, within the
ISO TC 211/SC: Geographic Information Standard - Encoding [#f6]_ the UUID definition did
comply to the fundamental requirements sought after:

    “An application domain defines a universe and an identification scheme called
    universal unique identifiers (UUIDs). A UUID is assigned to an object when it is
    created and is stable over the object's entire life span. The UUID of a deleted object
    cannot be used again. UUIDs are required for long-term distributed data management and
    for implementing update mechanisms. These identifiers are also called persistent
    identifiers. A special name server may be used to resolve persistent identifiers. The
    identifiers are unique within a well-defined limited universe defined by an application
    domain.”

This ISO definition is thus adopted for the “Identifier”. A UUID generation mechanism is
presented in the following section.

NVD Identification Standard
===========================

ID uniqueness is one of the fundamental characteristics that must be maintained. Two
techniques for making IDs unique were studied.

* The first consists of mandating a firm to generate and manage ID ranges depending on data
  producers.
* The second consists of using a unique ID generation algorithm [#f7]_ that could be used by data
  producers with no particular management of range and domain.

The *second* method is best suited and was the one retained.

A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time, with respect to the space
of all UUIDs. UUID generation does not require a registration authority for each single
identifier. Instead, it requires a unique value over space for each UUID generator. This
spatially unique value is specified as an IEEE 802 address, which is usually already applied
to network-connected systems. This 48-bit address can be assigned based on an address block
obtained through the IEEE registration authority. This UUID specification assumes the
availability of an IEEE 802 address.

The UUID consists of a 16-byte record and must void of padding between fields. The hexadecimal
values “a” to “f” must be lower case. The total size is 128 bits. For use as human-readable
text, a UUID string representation (32 characters) is specified as a sequence of fields. The
following string is a UUID example:

* 378a3917e824422cb25f268b8295da51

The assignation and persistence rules of the UUID are further explained in the
:doc:`change_management` document.

NID Values
==========

The algorithm described in the previous section provides producers the needed flexibility
while working within a network of partners. The algorithm can be used by all closest to
source data producers to modify the data and add a new NID when needed. **NIDs should only be
generated and assigned by authorized organizations**. Specific care must be given to the
management of NIDs. These NIDs will eventually allow for data synchronization between
organizations. Data users must ensure that they make **no alterations whatsoever to these** NIDs
value in order to ensure synchronization. Modifications to NID’s would render them useless
for data synchronization.
