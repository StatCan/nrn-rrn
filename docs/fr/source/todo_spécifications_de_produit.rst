Informal description of the data product
----------------------------------------

The National Road Network (NRN) product contains quality geospatial data (current, accurate, consistent and maintained)
of Canadian road phenomena. The NRN product is distributed in the form of thirteen provincial or territorial datasets
and consists of two linear entities (Road Segment and Ferry Connection Segment) and three punctual entities (Junction,
Blocked Passage, Toll Point) with which is associated a series of descriptive attributes such as, among others: First
House Number, Last House Number, Street Name Body, Place Name, Functional Road Class, Pavement Status, Number Of Lanes,
Structure Type, Route Number, Route Name, Exit Number.

The maintenance of the NRN data is done within the framework of intergovernmental partnership agreements (federal,
provincial, territorial and municipal) by interested closest to source governmental bodies capable of offering adequate
and current representations of the road phenomena. The frequency of maintenance aimed is of at least one update a year.
Data produced form a homogeneous and standardized view of the entire Canadian territory.

The NRN conceptual model was elaborated in collaboration with interested data providers and is adopted by the Canadian
Council on Geomatics (CCOG). The standard ISO 14825 — *Intelligent transport systems — Geographic Data Files (GDF) —
Overall data specification* served as a guide for the elaboration of the NRN conceptual model and catalogue. The NRN
vocabulary used (class names, attribute names and definitions) largely conforms to the ISO 14825.

Abstract
--------

The NRN product is distributed in the form of thirteen provincial or territorial datasets and consists of two linear
entities (Road Segment and Ferry Connection Segment) and three punctual entities (Junction, Blocked Passage, Toll
Point) with which is associated a series of descriptive attributes such as, among others: First House Number, Last
House Number, Street Name Body, Place Name, Functional Road Class, Pavement Status, Number Of Lanes, Structure Type,
Route Number, Route Name, Exit Number.

The development of the NRN was realized by means of individual meetings and national workshops with interested data
providers from the federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments.

In 2005, the NRN edition 2.0 was alternately adopted by members from the Inter-Agency Committee on Geomatics (IACG) and
the Canadian Council on Geomatics (CCOG). The NRN content largely conforms to the ISO 14825 from ISO/TC 204.

Purpose
-------

The National Road Network (NRN) provides quality geospatial and attributive data (current, accurate, consistent), homogeneous and normalized of the entire Canadian road network.

The NRN data serve as a foundation for several applications. This common geometric base is maintained on a regular basis by closest to the source organizations selected for their specific interests or for their ease in offering adequate, up-to-date representations of road phenomena, in accordance with the GeoBase initiative (www.geobase.ca). This common infrastructure facilitates data integration of NRN data with supplementary data.

Data Content and Structure
==========================

Description
-----------

The NRN product is distributed in the form of thirteen provincial or territorial datasets and consists of two linear
entities (Road Segment and Ferry Connection Segment) and three punctual entities (Junction, Blocked Passage, Toll
Point) with which is associated a series of descriptive attributes such as, among others: First House Number, Last
House Number, Street Name Body, Place Name, Functional Road Class, Pavement Status, Number Of Lanes, Structure Type,
Route Number, Route Name, Exit Number.

Addressing information (address range, street name and place name) linked to Road Segment entities are also distributed
in three distinct tables (Address Range, Street and Place Names and Alternate Name Link).

Data modelling schema used
--------------------------

Application schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The conceptual model of the NRN data is presented in the document *National Road Network, edition 2.0.1, Conceptual
Data Model, Segmented View* accessible on the GeoBase portal (www.geobase.ca).

The physical implementation of the NRN product differs from the conceptual model in what concerned the management of
object metadata and the addition of certain attributes to the entity Road Segment.

For the Object Metadata, the conceptual model foresees two distinct series of metadata attributes describing the
respective sources used for the creation and the revision of the data. Only the creation and revision dates were
distinctly specified. When a revision date is indicated and a geometric modification was applied on the object (with
regard to the previous dataset edition), the series of metadata attributes describes the sources used for revision.
Otherwise, Object Metadata attributes describe the sources used for creation.

The street name, place name and address range were also added as attributes on the geometry of the entity Road Segment.

The document *National Road Network, edition 2.0.1, Product Distribution Formats* also demonstrates the implementation
of the conceptual model into the physical model of the NRN data product according to the distribution formats GML,
KML and Shape (www.geobase.ca).

Feature catalogue

The feature catalogue entitled *National Road Network, edition 2.0.1, Feature Catalogue* can be found on the GeoBase
portal (www.geobase.ca).

Reference System
================

Spatial reference system
------------------------

Spatial data are expressed in latitude (φ) and longitude (λ) geographic coordinates in reference to the North American
Datum 1983 Canadian Spatial Reference System (NAD83CSRS). The longitude is stored as a negative number to represent a
position west of the prime meridian (0°). Coordinates measuring unit is the degree expressed as a 7-decimal real value.

Data quality
============

Completeness
------------

NRN product contains a quality geometric and attributive description (current, accurate, consistent), homogeneous and
standardised of the entire Canadian road network.

NRN road representation corresponds to centerline of all non restricted usage roads (5 meters wide or more, drivable
and not blocked by an obstacle). Roads isolated from the main road network, alleyways, resource and recreational roads
and addressing information may not be included in some NRN datasets.

.. note::
    Ferry connection segments are included in the NRN for the purpose of road network completeness.

Commission
^^^^^^^^^^

Evaluation methods used for the detection of data in excess is determined by each data provider.

Omission
^^^^^^^^

Evaluation methods used for the detection of missing data is determined by each data provider.

Logical consistency
-------------------

Conceptual consistency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The conceptual model of the NRN data can be found in the document *National Road Network, edition 2.0.1, Conceptual
Data Model, Segmented View* accessible on the GeoBase portal (www.geobase.ca).

The physical implementation of the NRN product differs from the conceptual model in what concerned the management of
object metadata and the addition of certain attributes to the entity Road Segment.

For the Object Metadata, the conceptual model foresees two distinct series of metadata attributes describing the
respective sources used for the creation and the revision of the data. Only the creation and revision dates were
distinctly specified. When a revision date is indicated and a geometric modification was applied on the object (with
regard to the previous dataset edition), the series of metadata attributes describes the sources used for revision.
Otherwise, Object Metadata attributes describe the sources used for creation.

The street name, place name and address range were also added as attributes on the geometry of the entity Road Segment.

Domain consistency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The attributive values are validated by means of an XML schema containing the definition of the authorized domain
values defined in the feature catalogue.

Authorized combinations of attribute values are validated by means of in-house software.

Format consistency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The NRN data formats conform to the distribution formats described in the document *National Road Network, edition 2.0.1,
Product Distribution Formats* accessible on the GeoBase portal (www.geobase.ca).

Topological consistency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The spatial relations of the entities of NRN datasets are systematically validated by means of in-house software.

The validation performed consists in detecting and correcting within reasonable measures: duplication of entities,
connection and valency between the linear and punctual entities, assignment of identifiers (NID), geometrical
incoherence ("spikes") and network continuity of route number, route name, street name and address ranges.

Positional accuracy
-------------------

Absolute external positional accuracy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The geometric accuracy of objects is given as the difference between objects position in the dataset and their real
ground positions measured in reference to the geodetic network. The accuracy may vary from one object to another. It
is thus provided in attribute with each feature occurrence and is expressed according to the Circular Map Accuracy
Standard (CMAS).

Standard Circular Error:

.. math::
    \sigma_c = 0.7071 (\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2)

    \sigma_x : standard deviation in the X-axis

    \sigma_y : standard deviation in the Y-axis

Circular Map Accuracy Standard:

.. math:: CMAS=2.1460 \sigma_c

The planimetric accuracy aimed for the product is 10 meters or better. Under the data maintenance phase, no systematic
validation of geometric and attributive accuracies is performed on all NRN datasets.

Data accuracy is evaluated according to the methods used to control acquisition sources (GPS, imagery, photogrammetry,
etc.) and the positioning errors inherent to data extraction. The method for evaluating data accuracy is determined by
the data provider.

Data Capture
============

Description
-----------

The method used for data acquisition is determined by each data provider. The selected method must allow for the
acquisition of quality geospatial data (current, accurate, consistent) for the entire dataset. Many acquisition sources
are used: GPS, orthoimages, orthophotos, photogrammetry.

Acquisition technique used by the provider is indicated in the object metadata associated with each entity occurrences.

Data Maintenance
================

Description
-----------

Maintenance of the NRN data is done within the framework of intergovernmental partnership agreements (federal,
provincial, territorial and municipal) by interested closest to source governmental bodies capable of offering
adequate and current representations of the road phenomena. The minimal frequency of maintenance updates is of at
least once a year.

In order to help NRN data users in their management of the various update releases, updates are packaged and
distributed by change effects (addition, retirement, modification, confirmation). By proceeding in this fashion,
identification rules as well as methods for classifying the modifications are established.

Identification rules on how to unequivocally identify entity occurrences are defined in the document entitled *National
Vector Data – Identification Rules* available on the GeoBase portal (www.geobase.ca).

The methods for classifying updates by change effects (addition, retirement, modification and confirmation) are
defined in the document *National Vector data – Change Management* available on the GeoBase portal (www.geobase.ca).
